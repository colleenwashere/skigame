    The canvas is where all of the action happens.  It is sized to
    600×800 pixels by default, but those values can be adjusted via
    attributes or CSS.  The surrounding container centers the game on
    the page.

         covers the entire game area and shows a large baseball player
         illustration alongside a speech bubble with the catch
         message.  Pressing the space bar hides this overlay and
         resumes play. -->
